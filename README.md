# PokemonMasters
Blender 2.79 import script for LMD files from Pokemon Masters - Based on Turk645's import script.

Just place it in your Blender install's AddOn folder and enable it in the preferences.

This fork adds some transparency sets and tries to detect and import textures.

CHANGELONG
V1.1: Adds support to models from v1.2 onward - Unfortunately I was unable to figure out how to autodetect so you have to select it manually.
